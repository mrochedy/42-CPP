# 42-CPP, by Maxime Rochedy

Welcome to my complete implementation of the **CPP Piscine** modules, completed as part of the **École 42** common core. The C++ Piscine is an intensive set of projects designed to provide a deep understanding of the core aspects of C++ programming. Each module was evaluated by two other students (three for the last module) and received the highest possible score of **100/100**.

Here, you'll find carefully crafted solutions to each exercise, showcasing my understanding of various C++ concepts, from basics to advanced topics. While my submissions were thoroughly reviewed, occasional errors may still exist, and constructive feedback is always welcome.

## About the Project

The **CPP Piscine** is an introduction to the world of C++, featuring a variety of modules that guide us from foundational C++ concepts to more advanced programming techniques. The purpose of this repository is to share my solutions to the **42 CPP Piscine** modules. These modules were completed by **Maxime Rochedy**, under the login **mrochedy**, during my time at **42**.

Please note that the content of this repository is provided for **learning purposes only**. To fully benefit from these exercises, try to implement the solutions yourself before referring to my work. Please respect the 42 school's policies on plagiarism.

## Getting Started

To explore the content of this repository, you can clone it as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrochedy/42-CPP.git
cd 42-CPP
```

Each module is organized in its own directory, with exercises that build on core C++ concepts. You are encouraged to explore these exercises, compile the code with the `make` command, and experiment with different implementations to enhance your understanding of the language.

## Modules Overview

Each module contains between **3 to 7 exercises** designed to teach specific concepts of C++.

- **Module 00**:
  Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff

- **Module 01**:
  Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement

- **Module 02**:
  Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form

- **Module 03**:
  Inheritance

- **Module 04**:
  Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces

- **Module 05**:
  Repetition and Exceptions

- **Module 06**:
  Casts

- **Module 07**:
  Templates

- **Module 08**:
  Templated containers, iterators, algorithms

- **Module 09**:
  STL, containers, algorithms implementation
